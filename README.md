Programs and scripts submitted as part of the Compiler Design Lab for the 8th semester of Mathematics & Computing.

## Lab 4
**Program 12 :** Lex Program to count number identifiers, keywords, operators in a file. 

**Program 13 :** Lex Program to generate a scanner that will take a decimal number between 1 to 999 in words and prints numeric value as output.

**Program 14 :** Lex program to count the no. of words starting with ab in a file.

**Program 15 :** Lex program to identify keywords and turn them into uppercase. 

**Program 16 :** Lex program to find the longest word in a file and reverse it.

**Program 17 :** Lex program to count the number of 'scanf' and 'printf' statement in a “C” program & replace them with 'readf' and 'writef' statements. 

**Program 18 :** Lex program to count the number of vowels and consonants in a file.

## Lab 3
**Program 9 :** Write a program in FLEX to check whether a given Identifier is valid or not. Create a symbol table for the same.

**Program 10 :** Write a program in FLEX to check whether a given Keyword is valid or not. Create a symbol table for the same.

**Program 11 :** Write a program in FLEX to check whether a given Operator is valid or not. Create a symbol table for the same.

>**Note:**  
For every input, the program should satisfy the following conditions:  
>* If the input is invalid - Return error message.  
>* If input is valid and it is not present in the symbol table - Make a new entry in the symbol table and return the corresponding index value.  
>* If the input is valid and it is present in the symbol table - Return the corresponding index value.

## Lab 2
**Program 6 :** Write a program to check whether a given Identifier is valid or not. Create a symbol table for the same.

**Program 7 :** Write a program to check whether a given Keyword is valid or not. Create a symbol table for the same.

**Program 8 :** Write a program to check whether a given Operator is valid or not. Create a symbol table for the same.

>**Note:**  
For every input, the program should satisfy the following conditions:  
>* If the input is invalid - Return error message.  
>* If input is valid and it is not present in the symbol table - Make a new entry in the symbol table and return the corresponding index value.  
>* If the input is valid and it is present in the symbol table - Return the corresponding index value.

## Lab 1
**Program 1 :** Write a C program to take another C program as input and store it into another file

**Program 2 :** Write a C program to count the number of lines in the stored C program

**Program 3 :** Write a C program to count the number of different operators in previously stored file

**Program 4 :** Write a C program to remove all white spaces, tabs and newline commands from stored C program and copy it into another file.

**Program 5 :** Write a C program to check the single and multiple comment lines in previously stored file.
